## magic-number

Welcome to the magic number game! Type any integer into the prompt and the game will respond. The game is based off a puzzle my friend showed me as a kid.

You might be able to figure out what's going on if you look at the source code....

### Installation instructions

This game runs in the command line. Ensure that [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) is installed.

Clone the repo, enter the folder, and type `stack run` to start the game. Stack should install the required libraries for you.

If you like, run unit tests on the game's library functions with `stack test`
